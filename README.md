# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition

Machine Learning Project to recognize handwritten digits from their images.<br />
Dataset is obtained from : [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/)<br />
The dataset consists of handwritten images in 28x28 format.<br />
The convert.py file is used to convert these images into a csv file<br />
The algorithm used is KNearest Neighbors Classifier.<br />
Using the metrics class the accuracy obtained is  :  97%.<br /><br />

Convolutional Neural Network Implementation in Jupyter Notebook.<br />
